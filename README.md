# Text_Generator_using_LSTM

# Text Generation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a text generation model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes loading and preprocessing a dataset, training a model, and generating human-like text. The notebook provides step-by-step guidance for each stage of the pipeline, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced practitioners in NLP.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for NLP tasks.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Implementation of text generation.
- Visualizations and performance metrics.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` or below):
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Any other dependencies specified in the notebook.

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/text-generation.git
   cd text-generation
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Copy_of_Text_gen_final.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the text generation pipeline.

## Dataset
The notebook either:
- Uses a pre-existing dataset for text generation (details provided in the notebook).
- Generates synthetic data for demonstration purposes.

Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory as specified in the notebook.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates:
- The training process of a text generation model.
- Generated text samples.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the model.

## Customization
You can:
- Use a different dataset by modifying the data loading section.
- Adjust hyperparameters for improved performance.
- Experiment with different model architectures.
